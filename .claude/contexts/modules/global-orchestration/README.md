# Global Orchestration Module

**Purpose**: Orchestrates complex multi-step workflows and coordinates task execution across any domain or project type.

## Overview

This module provides advanced orchestration capabilities for managing complex projects that require coordination between multiple agents, tools, and workflows.

## Use Cases

- **Project Management**: Coordinate project phases and milestones across any domain
- **Process Orchestration**: Manage multi-step processes and workflows
- **Complex Operations**: Orchestrate multi-phase operations and procedures
- **Cross-Domain Tasks**: Coordinate between different areas of expertise
- **Resource Management**: Manage resource allocation and task distribution
- **Quality Assurance**: Coordinate validation and verification processes

## Core Features

### Task Orchestration
- Parallel task execution management
- Dependency resolution and sequencing
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Error handling and rollback strategies

### Agent Coordination
- Multi-agent workflow coordination
- Specialized agent deployment (UI, API, DevOps, etc.)
- Load balancing and resource management
- Cross-agent communication

### Workflow Templates
- Pre-defined orchestration patterns
- Customizable workflow blueprints
- Best practice implementations
- Reusable process definitions

## Required Tools

- `Task` - Agent deployment and coordination
- `TodoWrite` - Progress tracking and planning
- `MultiEdit` - Batch file operations
- `Bash` - Command execution coordination

## Configuration

The module is configured through the main `settings.json` file under `modules.global-orchestration.config`:
- Default orchestration patterns
- Agent priority levels  
- Timeout and retry policies
- Notification preferences

See `.claude/settings.json` for current configuration.

## Usage Example

```markdown
# Example: Multi-Phase Project Execution
1. Planning Phase (planning-agent)
2. Resource Preparation (preparation-agent)
3. Core Implementation (specialized-agents)
4. Integration Phase (integration-agent)
5. Validation Phase (validation-agent)
6. Documentation & Handoff (completion-agent)
```

## Integration

This module integrates with:
- Environment Variables (OS_TYPE optimization)
- Custom Agents (meta-agent for dynamic agent generation)
- Other specialized modules as they're developed
- External systems and APIs
- Project management and coordination tools
- Any domain-specific tools and platforms

### Meta-Agent Integration

The `meta-agent` is configured to automatically:
- Generate new specialized agents based on user descriptions
- Register new agents in the orchestration priorities
- Maintain consistent agent structure and naming conventions
- Enable seamless integration with workflow templates
